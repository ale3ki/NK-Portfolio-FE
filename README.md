# Nicolaas's Portfolio 

This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with 
```markdown 
create-next-app@latest project-name --use-npm
```

## Naming Conventions

### Pages

All directories and files inside the `app` directory, which represent pages, use camelCase naming.

For example, if you have two pages that display different projects, the directory structure might look like this:

```markdown
app/
â””â”€â”€ projects/
    â”œâ”€â”€ projectOne/
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ page.jsx
    â””â”€â”€ projectTwo/
        â””â”€â”€ page.jsx
```        

# Components

For components, the directory names follow camel case, while the component file names follow Pascal case.

For example, if you have two components that display different types of project cards, the directory structure might look like this:

```markdown
components/
â”œâ”€â”€ ProjectCardOne/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ component.jsx
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ styles.module.css
â””â”€â”€ ProjectCardTwo/
    â”œâ”€â”€ component.jsx
    â””â”€â”€ styles.module.css
```
## Importing Components and Pages

When you want to use these components or pages in your application, you'll need to import them into the file where they'll be used.

### Pages

For pages, you can import them using their path relative to the file where you're importing. For example, if you're in a file at the root of your project and you want to import the `page.jsx` from `projectOne`, you would do:

```jsx
import ProjectOne from './app/projects/projectOne/page';

```

### Components

For components, the process is similar. If you're in a file at the root of your project and you want to import the component.jsx from projectCardOne, you would do:

```jsx
import ProjectCardOne from './components/ProjectCardOne/component';

```

# ApiService (APS) - Custom API DataStore

## Overview

ApiService is a data management class designed to interact with a RESTful .NET backend. It facilitates the retrieval and caching of data, in addition to automating fetch operations. The service has an inherent error-handling mechanism and features a single getter for container data. The class is instantiated once at the top-level (in layout.tsx), and it starts automatically when a consumer first loads the website.

### Key Characteristics

- **Automated Fetch Operations:** The service is designed to fetch all page data upfront and cache it for quick and easy access. If a consumer requests data before it has been loaded, the service can load it asynchronously.

- **Error Handling:** The service includes mechanisms to handle any errors that occur during the fetch operation. It can identify and log various types of errors, such as network errors or errors related to missing page or container data.

- **Cached Data Store:** All page data fetched by the service is stored in a local cache, allowing components to quickly retrieve the data they need without additional network requests.

- **Single 'Getter' for Container Data:** The service provides a single public method, getContainerDataByPageID, which components can use to fetch data for specific containers. A 'container' here represents a 'section' of data that might be used by multiple components.

### Fetching Data for an Individual Container

To fetch data for an individual container (or 'section'), you can use the getContainerDataByPageID method provided by the ApiService. This method requires two parameters: pageID and containerID.

Here is an example of how to use this method:

```javascript
try {
  // Replace pageId and containerId with the actual IDs of the page and container you're interested in
  const containerData = await apiService.getContainerDataByPageID(pageId, containerId);
  
  if (containerData) {
    // You can now use containerData in your component
  } else {
    console.log('No data found for given page and container IDs');
  }
} catch (error) {
  console.error(`An error occurred: ${error}`);
}
```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
